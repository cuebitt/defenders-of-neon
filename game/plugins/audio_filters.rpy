#### Audio Filter Templates ####
# Thank you for downloading my filter pack! (https://berinrin.itch.io/audiofilter-templates-for-renpy)
# Just drop this file into your Ren'Py project, and you can start using the audio filters
#
# Example using the walkie_talkie_af filter:
#                                 v sound channel to apply the filter to (e.g. music, sound, voice)
# $ renpy.music.set_audio_filter("sound", walkie_talkie_af)
# play sound <your sound here>
#
# To remove the filter again, set it to "None" like this:
#
# $ renpy.music.set_audio_filter("sound", None)
#
# Check out the official documentation for audio filters if you want to change these (https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/audio_filters.html)
# You don't need to credit me, but if you do it regardless, I'd be happy!
